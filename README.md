Hi Visitor!

This is the repo for my solution to the assignment from David Silver's Reinforcement Learning class at UCL.  
You can find the course here: https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/  
The assigment questions are here: https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Easy21-Johannes.pdf  

The scripts for the questions are in the following files:  
[q1_environment.py](q1_environment.py)  
[q2_monte_carlo_control.py](q2_monte_carlo_control.py)  
[q3_sarsa.py](q3_sarsa.py)  
[q4_linear_fn_approx.py](q4_linear_fn_approx.py)  

The solution notebook with the plots included is in 
[solution.ipynb](solution.ipynb)  

The rest of the files are just for storing results and generating the plots and gifs.

Shoutout to [hereismari](https://github.com/hereismari/easy21) for the inspiration for the gifs.

Disclaimer:
I have completed this just to have fun, I have not officially submitted the assignment. I have no way of
verifying how correct the results are. If your results don't look like this it is entirely possible that I have a bug somewhere :)
In that case, please let me know!
